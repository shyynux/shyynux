## hi 🎀༘

I am a full-stack developer aka software engineer 🫶🏽 🌷  I have experience in multiple programming languages and technologies. 🪐༘  For my personal projects here I am building with [`NodeJS`](https://nodejs.org/en/about), [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/), [` React `](https://react.dev/), [` TailwindCSS `](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [` ExpressJS `](https://expressjs.com/). 
I have worked with Java, Kotlin, C#, Azure and AWS during my previous jobs and internships.

## current life update 🌷

I am working on multiple projects, two projects will be posted soon where you can contribute in hacktoberfest 2024, the tech stack will be the same that I mentioned above or maybe I will add python as well (let's see). 💌

Apart from that, I am working on building [`snow`] (a saas starter kit) and [`lyricUI`] (a ui library for tailwindcss). My goal is to launch atleast one thing on product hunt by the end of 2024. 

I love learning and currently I am passionate about all things system design. I also get a lot of ideas so idk what else I will do in 2024, but these are the current plans. 
I enjoy coffee, binge watching, beautiful natural places and good conversations.

## 🧸 Experience

In my current full time job I work as a software engineer and I am still learning java and other internal libraries. I rarely talk about my job work because I love sharing my personal and passion projects on github and twitter. 

At my last job, I worked with AWS (SQS, SNS, ECS, Lambda, DynamoDB etc) and Kotlin, it was a good experience with a great team. I worked on a multitude of projects and got to see massive scale which was cool. ☁︎ During my college internship, I worked with C# and Azure Devops. It was my first time with C# and it made me realise that _language is just a tool_ and we can get upto speed with a language if we know the basics.

During my college years, I built projects using Django and Java as well, my favourite was a code compiler I built (basically used my linux machine’s compiler). I built lot of projects using Django and explored design patterns like OOPS, POJO, factory methods using Java. Java is a beautiful language. I also fell in love with CSS animations, building CSS projects (thx to [`freecodecamp`](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)).
